# Contributors Guide!

## Making a contribution

1. Clone the repository into a suitable folder (this only needs to be done once)
 - `git clone https://github.com/jackyzha0/NEAT-genetic-algo.git`
2. Make a new branch for your ticket
 - `git checkout -b NAME-OF-BRANCH`
3. Make your changes! Edit whatever is needed.
4. Add your changes and commit
 - `git add .`
 - `git commit -m "short description"`
 - `git push origin NAME-OF-BRANCH`
5. Go to GitHub and create a pull request to merge your branch into master.
6. Request reviews and delete branch after you're finished!

## Keeping up to date with changes

It's as simple as `git pull origin master`

## Naming Conventions
All branches should be of the form `name-number-desc`, where `name` is one of `IMP`, `MATH`, or `POSTER`, `number` is the ticket number on Asana, and `desc` is a short 3-5 word description of your PR.

<br>

e.g. `IMP-003-add-readme`

## All PRs require one approval
Please make sure to ping if it takes longer than 1-2 days for your PR to be approved.
