# Mathematics behind Genetic Algorithms 

## Goal

Explain the mathematics behind the genetic algorithm of our project, including NEAT, and connect mathematics and statistics to biological concepts like natural selection and genetic change.

## Approach

Effects of Certain Constants (Mutation rate, etc)
- Impact of the major components of all genetic algorithms
    - Encoding: Create a space of solutions
    - Fitness function: Discriminate good from bad solutions
    - Initialization: Start with good candidate solutions
    - Selection: Prefer better solutions to worse ones
    - Recombination: Combine parental traits in a novel manner
    - Mutation: Creating individual traits by random local search
    - Termination: Comparing achieved and achievable fitness

- How these factors should be manually selected and the implications of doing so

Math Behind Crossing Over/Mutation
- An explanation of how the next generation of chromosomes is chosen from a mathematical perspective
- Involves how the fitness of an individual impacts its chance of reproduction and survival
- Explanation with reference to the representation of natural selection as well as how the probability of random mutation impacts this

How GAs Approximate Global Minima/Maxima of the Fitness Function
- How the biological/evolutionary fitness of individuals should be represented mathematically
- Optimization of individual traits to fit the function and reach a maximum with many generations
