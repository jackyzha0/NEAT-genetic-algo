\subsection{\underline{Crossover}}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Choose a pair of individuals which were selected to reproduce. 
\item Combine each pair's genome into one
\bi
\item Using randomized selection, choose a number $c$ in range $[1,L-1]$ where $L$ is the character length of the genome string of the species.
\item Now take the substring of the first individual's genome from $[0, c]$ and append it to the substring of the second individual's genome from $(c, L]$. 
\item This will result in a new combined genome with genes from each parent.
\item Create a specified amount of offspring based off the fitness function for each individual, and summing these values. Let function $O$
\item $O$
\ei
\item Repeat $2.$ for each pair of individuals selected to reproduce in the population. After this process is complete, a new set of $500$ offspring should be created, representing the next generation of the species.
