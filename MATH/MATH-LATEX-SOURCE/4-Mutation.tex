\subsection{\underline{Mutation}}

Building off of the overview, we will be choosing a small probability of 
mutation.
\bi
\item This probability is usually less than 0.01, so we will choose
$p_m = 0.005$.
\item Now, for each gene (bit) in an individual, we flip it with this probability. 
\item Then this process is repeated for all offspring until a sufficiently diverse new population is produced and ready to repeat the process once again.
\item Mutations are extremely important for the process of natural selection despite their low chances of occurring. Both selection and mutation contribute to continual improvement in the next generation.
