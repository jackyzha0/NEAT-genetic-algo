\section{\underline{Mutation}}

\subsection{Methodology}
We will be choosing a small probability of 
mutation.
\bi
\item This probability is usually less than 0.01, so we will choose
$p_m = 0.005$.
\item Now, for each gene (bit) in an individual, we flip it with this probability. 
\item Then this process is repeated for all offspring until a sufficiently diverse new population is produced and ready to repeat the process once again.
\item Mutations are extremely important for the process of natural selection despite their low chances of occurring. Both selection and mutation contribute to continual improvement in the next generation.

\subsection{Connection to Biology}
One of the differences between our implementation and how mutation 
occurs in nature is that while both change DNA at a particular place, their
purposes are different. In nature, mutation is a weak force for changing 
allele frequencies but key for evolution because of being a strong force
for introducing new alleles. In our implementation however, mutation is not
used to introduce new alleles, rather it is used to change allele frequencies
more in the fashion of genetic drift to create diversity.
